The tiddlywebplugins.atom packages provide serialization modules to
do a very simple Atom format syndication of collections of tiddlers
(including one tiddler, and filtered tiddlers).

One serialization provides support for the Atom format, another
extends the existing HTML serialization to provide <link> elements
referring to the Atom feeds.

Atom formatted output can be had by requesting the application/atom+xml
format, or by appending a .atom to the end of a URL (before the query
portion) that returns one or more tiddlers.

To use this code install the package and then add 'tiddlywebplugins.atom'
to system_plugins in the tiddlywebconfig.py of your instance:

    config = {
        'system_plugins': ['tiddlywebplugins.atom'],
    }

If tiddlywebplugins.differ is on sys.path and a depth=<some number>
argument is supplied to the feed URL, then the resulting feed will be
the tiddlers requested presented as diffs between tiddler revisions. The
number of revisions shown is controlled by <some number>.

You can get tiddlywebplugins.differ from PyPI:
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tiddlywebplugins.differ

The Atom code is borrowed from Django's django/utils/feedgenerator.py
