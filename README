The tiddlywebplugins.atom package provides serialization modules to
do a very simple Atom format syndication of collections of tiddlers
(including one tiddler, and filtered tiddlers) hosted by
[TiddlyWeb](http:/tiddlyweb.com).

One serialization provides support for the Atom format, the other
extends the existing HTML serialization to provide `<link>` elements
referring to the Atom feeds.

Atom formatted output can be had by requesting the `application/atom+xml`
format, or by appending a `.atom` to the end of a URL (before the query
portion) that returns one or more tiddlers.

To use this code install the package and then add `tiddlywebplugins.atom`
to [system_plugins](http://tiddlyweb.tiddyspace.com/system_plugins] in
the [tiddlywebconfig.py](http://tiddlyweb.tiddlyspace.com/tiddlywebconfig.py]
of your instance:

    config = {
        'system_plugins': ['tiddlywebplugins.atom'],
    }

If [tiddlywebplugins.differ](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tiddlywebplugins.differ)
is on `sys.path` and a `depth=<some number>` argument is supplied to the
feed URL, then the resulting feed will be the tiddlers requested presented
as diffs between tiddler revisions. The number of revisions shown is
controlled by `<some number>`.

By default the feed given is all the tiddlers in the collection represented
by the given URI, in no particular order. This is not always the best
default. If you want a different default you can set `atom.default_filter`
in `tiddlywebconfig.py` to a string that represents a TiddlyWeb filter.
For example:

    'atom.default_filter': 'select=tag:!excludeLists;sort=-modified;limit=20',
 
would give the 20 most recently modified tiddlers which are not tagged
`excludeLists`.

The Atom code was original adapted from Django's django/utils/feedgenerator.py
which itself was then extracted to its own package.
